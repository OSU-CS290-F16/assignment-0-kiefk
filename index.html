			<li> Interesting fact: Last spring I performed at Disneyland with OSU's ballroom dance team cool shoes. <br/>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I made it through one half of one song and got kicked in the head by my teammate during a trick. 
				<br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had to go to urgent care and get my head superglued! </li>
