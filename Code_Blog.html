		<h2> Assignment 0 - 9/25/16</h2>
			<p>	I had a really hard time with this assignment because there wasn't as much direction as I expected 
				<br/>from an introductory course. At the start I didn't even know what Git was, let alone where or
				<br/>how to use it, and I had to spend quite a few hours Googling to be able to work on the assignment.
				<br/> Because I am not familiar with Git, getting a tutorial for how to use it was not a good place 
				<br/> for me to start. I would have appreciated a crash course on what Git is and Git/Github specific
				<br/> terms. I didn't know where to use the information the tutorial was trying to teach me or what
				<br/> the terms: commit, push, pull, clone, repository, etc mean in regards to Git and Github. 
				<br/> I ended up using <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc" title="Git - Documentation"> this </a>
				documentation the most for git commands and how to use them. Before this I knew nothing, now I think
				<br/> I have a pretty basic understanding of Git/Github and html. I used
				<a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/resources/" title="OSU Linux Users Group"> this </a> website to teach me
				<br/> what everyone meant by "using flip". The harderst part was definitely figuring out how to download
				<br/> and upload files off of Github using Git. I really liked the link on the class page for html basics.
